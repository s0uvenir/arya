A custom Data Mining toolkit.

Currently implements:
* ZeroR
* Naive Bayes
* A Decision Tree Classifier (with InfoGain)
* A simple optimization model (Schaffer)

Usage can be viewed in main.py for now

Example output (of the decision tree classifier) can be viewed via out.txt, all others output raw text stats.


Currently Working on the Particle Swarm Optimization Portion of the project.
